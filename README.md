# sortingHat


**A group project with:**
*Chris Lojacano*
*Ryan McNair*
*Bailey Dennis*


**My contribution:**

I contributed fixes to how it was printing to DOM (to make it print multiples), fixed expel function, minor fixes on other things, and added validation for null values and duplicates (and general cheerleading and brainstorming).
